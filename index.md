## About
This project aims to understand the broader spatial patterns of educational attainment, enrollment, and other relevant demographic or socio-economic indicators and explore the relationship between public school distribution and broader educational patterns in New Jersey. Research Questions:
What are the spatial patterns of educational attainment (e.g., high school and higher degrees) across counties and census tracts in New Jersey?
How do enrollment rates vary across census tracts and counties in New Jersey?
How does the distribution of public schools align with regions of high or low educational attainment and enrollment?
Are there regions with limited school access that also exhibit lower educational outcomes?
